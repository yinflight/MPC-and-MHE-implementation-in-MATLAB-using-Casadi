# MPC-and-MHE-implementation-in-MATLAB-using-Casadi
This is a workshop on implementing model predictive control (MPC) and moving horizon estimation (MHE) on Matlab. The implementation is based on the Casadi Package which is used for numerical optimization. A non-holonomic mobile robot is used as a system for the implementation.
